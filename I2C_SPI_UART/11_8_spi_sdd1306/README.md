# _ATTENTION!_

I used a JDY-23 instead a JDY-31.
My PC and smartphone doesn't support this device (connection to the bluetooth device fails every time I try).
Download and install "Serial Bluetooth Terminal" from the Play Store and connect using it.

## CONNECTIONS

    * VCC to 5V
    * GND to ground
    * TXD to GPIO21
    * RXD to GPIO19
